# memory-vault

Maintain a project's persistent Memory Vault (`.memory/`) by initializing, reading, updating after code changes, reorganizing after large shifts, and compacting when it grows beyond limits. The vault is current-state documentation, never a timeline—it enforces strict rules against dates, commit hashes, status language, narrative tone, and other prohibited patterns to keep knowledge artifacts clean, accurate, and durable.
